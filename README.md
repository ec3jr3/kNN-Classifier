# kNN-Classifier
k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.

The file "data.csv" is the dataset. To predict diabetes. 

The following features have been provided to help us predict whether a person is diabetic or not:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

HOW TO RUN THE CLASSIFIER 

1)download anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d
2) in the terminal put the direction of where the folder is
3) command : ls
4) command : python

5)import the file.py
6)call the function that is in the KNN.py file
